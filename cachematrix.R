## We have two functions that are used to create a special vector that stores a numeric vector and cacheâ€™s its mean

## makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
## 1.- set the value of the matrix
## 2.- get the value of the matrix
## 3.- set the value of inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
